### 1. Massive Drop-Off Rate
- **78% of visitors leave at 5% scroll depth** (only 125/160 continue)

- **Only 3 visitors (1.87%) reach the bottom** of the page

### 2. Attention Concentration Problems
- **25% scroll depth gets 24.41% of attention time** - major friction point
- Users spending 1:49 at this point (likely the first form or confusing section)
- Sharp drop after: only 13.25% attention at 30% depth

### 3. Low Engagement Metrics
- **Only 121 total clicks from 160 page views** (0.76 clicks per visitor)
- Top clicked elements are utility buttons (close buttons, chat widgets)
